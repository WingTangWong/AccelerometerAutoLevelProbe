AccelerometerAutoLevelProbe
===========================

Code and circuitry to use an accelerometer as a 3d printer auto-leveling probe detector to signal z axis min end stop


Status
======

Awaiting delivery of accelerometer so I can start writing interface code. 

This is related to my AutoTuningFSR github project: https://github.com/WingTangWong/AutoTuningFSRTrigger

Both work as non-moving part auto-level probe triggers for 3d printers.
